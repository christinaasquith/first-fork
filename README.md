# Horizon

On March 25th 2023, 40 Girl Scouts and Hack Clubbers will gather in NYC for a day of coding and tinkering with creative projects to share with the world.

Horizon is a collaboration between [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com) and the [Girl Scouts of Greater NY](https://www.girlscoutsnyc.org/). This repository shows all of the behind the scenes in making Horizon come alive, right now that's the code for the website and our projects board.
